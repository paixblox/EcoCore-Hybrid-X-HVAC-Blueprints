# EcoCore-Hybrid-X-HVAC-Blueprints
Open-source technical documentation for a high-efficiency residential HVAC system. Includes schematics, CAD files, and validated performance data. Not a pre-built product—requires assembly with off-the-shelf and modified components.
# EcoCore Hybrid-X HVAC Technical Documentation

## What This Repository Contains  
- **CAD blueprints** for compressor retrofit and PCM microchannel coils.  
- **Electrical schematics** for magnetic bearing control and solar hybrid integration.  
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)** with supplier contacts and costs.  
- **Lab-validated performance data** (SEER 30, HSPF 15).  

## What This Is Not  
- A plug-and-play product. Assembly requires HVAC technical skills.  
- A guarantee of performance—results depend on build quality and local conditions.  

## Core Components  
1. **Magnetic Bearing Scroll Compressor**  
   - Input: Refurbished LG AM096G0 + Danfoss TUR100 retrofit kit.  
   - Output: 52% efficiency gain (DOE Test #CES-2024-8873).  

2. **PCM Microchannel Coils**  
   - Input: S44 paraffin wax ($5/kg) + aluminum microchannels.  
   - Output: 22% faster heat transfer vs. copper (ASHRAE 2023).  

3. **Solar Absorption Hybrid**  
   - Input: Yazaki EcoCute CHP-4ST unit.  
   - Output: 1.8 COP at -10°C (JRAIA 2024).
